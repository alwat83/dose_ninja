Database schema: The code assumes a PostgreSQL database with specific tables and columns, but the schema is not defined. You would need to create the database schema and tables to match the code.
Authentication and authorization: The code assumes that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the prescription data, but there is no implementation of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Error handling: The code does not handle errors properly. You should add try-catch blocks and error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors.
Validation: The code does not validate user input data. You should add validation logic to ensure that the data is correct and consistent.
Business logic: The code only provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for prescriptions and medication schedules. You would need to add additional business logic to handle more complex scenarios, such as medication interactions, allergies, and refill reminders.
RxNorm API integration: The code does not integrate with the RxNorm API to retrieve medication information. You would need to add API calls and data processing to integrate with RxNorm.
MedlinePlus API integration: The code does not integrate with the MedlinePlus API to retrieve health information and resources. You would need to add API calls and data processing to integrate with MedlinePlus.
Security: The code does not implement security measures, such as encryption and secure password storage. You should add security measures to protect user data.
To make this a working model, you would need to address these gaps and add additional functionality to create a comprehensive prescription management system.
