Here is an example of how you can implement authentication and authorization for the prescription management system:

Authentication:

User Registration: Create a registration endpoint that allows users to create an account. The endpoint should accept a username, password, and email address as input. The password should be hashed and stored securely in the database.
Login: Create a login endpoint that allows users to log in with their username and password. The endpoint should verify the password against the hashed password stored in the database. If the password is correct, the endpoint should return a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the user's ID and other relevant information.
JWT Verification: Create a middleware function that verifies the JWT on each request. The middleware function should check the signature of the JWT and ensure that it has not expired. If the JWT is valid, the middleware function should extract the user's ID and other relevant information from the JWT.
Authorization:

Role-Based Access Control: Create a role-based access control system that assigns roles to users. For example, you can create roles such as "patient", "doctor", and "pharmacist". Each role should have a set of permissions that define what actions the user can perform.
Permission-Based Authorization: Create a permission-based authorization system that checks the user's permissions on each request. The system should check the user's role and permissions to ensure that they have access to the requested resource or action.
Example Code:

Here is an example of how you can implement authentication and authorization using Node.js and Express.js:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// User registration endpoint
app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password, email } = req.body;
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  const user = await User.create({ username, password: hashedPassword, email });
  res.json({ message: 'User created successfully' });
});

// Login endpoint
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = await User.findOne({ username });
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' });
  }
  const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid username or password' });
  }
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, process.env.SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

// JWT verification middleware
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization');
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET_KEY);
    req.user = await User.findById(decoded.userId);
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
});

// Role-based access control middleware
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const user = req.user;
  const role = user.role;
  const permissions = role.permissions;
  if (!permissions.includes(req.method + req.path)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
  }
  next();
});

// Protected endpoint
app.get('/prescriptions', async (req, res) => {
  const user = req.user;
  const prescriptions = await Prescription.find({ userId: user.id });
  res.json(prescriptions);
});

This example uses the bcrypt library to hash and compare passwords, and the jsonwebtoken library to generate and verify JWTs. The example also uses a simple role-based access control system to authorize requests.

Note that this is just an example, and you should consider implementing additional security measures such as password salting, secure password storage, and secure JWT signing and verification.
