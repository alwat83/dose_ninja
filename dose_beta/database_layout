Relationships:

A user can have multiple prescriptions (one-to-many).
A prescription belongs to one user (many-to-one).
A prescription can have multiple medication schedules (one-to-many).
A medication schedule belongs to one prescription (many-to-one).
A medication can have multiple RxNorm maps (one-to-many).
An RxNorm map belongs to one medication (many-to-one).
Indexes:

Create an index on the users.username column to improve login performance.
Create an index on the prescriptions.user_id column to improve prescription retrieval performance.
Create an index on the medication_schedule.prescription_id column to improve medication schedule retrieval performance.
This schema assumes that each user can have multiple prescriptions, each prescription can have multiple medication schedules, and each medication can have multiple RxNorm maps. The RxNorm map table is used to store the RxNorm identifiers for each medication, which can be used to retrieve medication information from the RxNorm API.

Note that this is just one possible database schema, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you will need to create the necessary database constraints, such as foreign key constraints, to ensure data consistency.
