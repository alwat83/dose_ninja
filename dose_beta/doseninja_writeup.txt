These technologies work together to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for users to track and manage their medications.

Create a presciption managemnt system for the user using these techonligies for the backend for dose ninja?

Here's a high-level design for a prescription management system using the technologies mentioned earlier for the backend of Dose Ninja:

Prescription Management System

The prescription management system will allow users to manage their prescriptions, including tracking medication schedules, dosages, and refill reminders. The system will also allow users to add, edit, and delete prescriptions.

Database Schema

The database schema will consist of the following tables:

users
id (primary key)
username
password (hashed)
email
prescriptions
id (primary key)
user_id (foreign key referencing the users table)
medication_name
dosage
frequency
start_date
end_date
refill_reminder (boolean)
medication_schedule
id (primary key)
prescription_id (foreign key referencing the prescriptions table)
dose_date
dose_time
taken (boolean)
API Endpoints

The API will expose the following endpoints:

GET /prescriptions
Retrieve a list of all prescriptions for a user
Parameters: user_id
Response: JSON array of prescription objects
GET /prescriptions/:id
Retrieve a single prescription by ID
Parameters: id
Response: JSON object representing the prescription
POST /prescriptions
Create a new prescription
Parameters: user_id, medication_name, dosage, frequency, start_date, end_date, refill_reminder
Response: JSON object representing the created prescription
PUT /prescriptions/:id
Update an existing prescription
Parameters: id, medication_name, dosage, frequency, start_date, end_date, refill_reminder
Response: JSON object representing the updated prescription
DELETE /prescriptions/:id
Delete a prescription
Parameters: id
Response: 204 No Content
GET /medication_schedule
Retrieve a list of medication schedules for a user
Parameters: user_id
Response: JSON array of medication schedule objects
GET /medication_schedule/:id
Retrieve a single medication schedule by ID
Parameters: id
Response: JSON object representing the medication schedule
POST /medication_schedule
Create a new medication schedule
Parameters: prescription_id, dose_date, dose_time, taken
Response: JSON object representing the created medication schedule
PUT /medication_schedule/:id
Update an existing medication schedule
Parameters: id, dose_date, dose_time, taken
Response: JSON object representing the updated medication schedule
DELETE /medication_schedule/:id
Delete a medication schedule
Parameters: id
Response: 204 No Content
Business Logic

The business logic will be implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The API endpoints will be secured using Passport.js and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Prescription Creation
Validate user input for prescription creation
Check for medication interactions and allergies
Create a new prescription in the database
Send a confirmation email to the user
Prescription Updates
Validate user input for prescription updates
Check for medication interactions and allergies
Update the prescription in the database
Send a confirmation email to the user
Medication Schedule Generation
Generate a medication schedule based on the prescription frequency and dosage
Store the medication schedule in the database
Refill Reminders
Check for prescriptions that need refill reminders
Send a refill reminder email to the user
RxNorm API Integration

The RxNorm API will be used to retrieve medication information, including medication names, dosages, and frequencies.

MedlinePlus API Integration

The MedlinePlus API will be used to retrieve health information and resources related to medications.

Security

The API will use HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure data transmission. User passwords will be hashed and stored securely in the database.

This design provides a robust and scalable prescription management system for Dose Ninja, allowing users to manage their prescriptions and medication schedules effectively.

Write the code for this?

Here is an example implementation of the prescription management system using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL:

prescription-model.js

const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'doseninja',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'doseninja',
  password: 'password',
  port: 5432,
});

class Prescription {
  async getAllPrescriptions(userId) {
    const result = await pool.query({
      text: `SELECT * FROM prescriptions WHERE user_id = $1`,
      values: [userId],
    });
    return result.rows;
  }

  async getPrescription(id) {
    const result = await pool.query({
      text: `SELECT * FROM prescriptions WHERE id = $1`,
      values: [id],
    });
    return result.rows[0];
  }

  async createPrescription(userId, medicationName, dosage, frequency, startDate, endDate, refillReminder) {
    const result = await pool.query({
      text: `INSERT INTO prescriptions (user_id, medication_name, dosage, frequency, start_date, end_date, refill_reminder) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7) RETURNING *`,
      values: [userId, medicationName, dosage, frequency, startDate, endDate, refillReminder],
    });
    return result.rows[0];
  }

  async updatePrescription(id, medicationName, dosage, frequency, startDate, endDate, refillReminder) {
    const result = await pool.query({
      text: `UPDATE prescriptions SET medication_name = $2, dosage = $3, frequency = $4, start_date = $5, end_date = $6, refill_reminder = $7 WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *`,
      values: [id, medicationName, dosage, frequency, startDate, endDate, refillReminder],
    });
    return result.rows[0];
  }

  async deletePrescription(id) {
    await pool.query({
      text: `DELETE FROM prescriptions WHERE id = $1`,
      values: [id],

module.exports = Prescription;

  async createMedicationSchedule(prescriptionId, doseDate, doseTime, taken) {
    const result = await pool.query({
      text: `INSERT INTO medication_schedule (prescription_id, dose_date, dose_time, taken) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4) RETURNING *`,
      values: [prescriptionId, doseDate, doseTime, taken],
    });

      values: [id, doseDate, doseTime, taken],
    });
    return result.rows[0];
